# Darrin

## Travelogue

The Systemized Selling Playbook represents Darrin's framework for helping bootstrapped solo-founders develop their differentiator, messaging, and sales process. This tool streamlines the process of completing the playbook and provides AI-powered feedback to strengthen answers.

## Ideas

- Generate initial answers from context
- Grade responses A-F on specificity and clarity
- Provide specific improvement feedback
- Challenge vague or generic statements
- Push for concrete, differentiated messaging
- Save progress with metadata (timing, tokens, word count)
- Review and reload previous sessions
- Export completed playbooks
- Compare answers across iterations
- Track improvement over time

## TODO
