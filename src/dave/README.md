# David

## Travelogue

David is CEO of Mask. Working with him, one thing that stands out is he's got a pattern in how he likes to conversate. Very social oriented: this person, story about a thing, here's why it's relevant, here's what the opportunity might be, here's what's happening next that does or does not involve you. Literally a half a dozen of these in any given moment.

## Ideas

- Build a system that captures some of that
- Evaluate if it's not new
- Play a supplemental role
- Experiment with the new transcribe endpoint that supports diarization and multiple speakers
- Detect is this Dave talking or not Dave talking

## TODO

- [x] Start cloning
- [ ] Author travelogue
