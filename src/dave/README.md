# David

Social conversational pattern mapper. Captures David’s storytelling framework: person → story → relevance → opportunity → next steps.

## Travelogue

CEO of Mask. Notable pattern: this person, story about a thing, here’s why it’s relevant, here’s what the opportunity might be, here’s what’s happening next that does or does not involve you. Literally a half a dozen of these in any given moment.
