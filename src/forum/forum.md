## Matt’s notes

### What’s real and what’s BS?

My goal today is the same as every day — to cut through the noisy barrage of AI news and products to find what’s real, usable, and helpful.

After 3 years and about 100 hours per month researching AI, I find myself dazed and confused.

Hype vs. reality — nobody has a true “virtual workforce” and **everything today still needs supervision.**

[IBM says only 24% of companies have AI agents taking independent action.](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/agentic-ai-operating-model)

[This post on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/awilkinson_dp-digital-people-we-build-digital-employees-activity-7380230237994991616-6vt8/) claims _“I hired 12 new employees last month. They work 24/7. Never complain. Never take vacation.”_ → now I like Andrew, but the reality is **AI is NOT there yet** → that same week the creators of ChatGPT showed the maximum continuous productivity in highly controlled tests is maybe 30 hours → last week [a company admitted their unsupervised AI agents got into an unapproved, unproductive 12-day conversation costing $47,000](https://pub.towardsai.net/we-spent-47-000-running-ai-agents-in-production-heres-what-nobody-tells-you-about-a2a-and-mcp-5f845848de33)

Fact: AI cannot independently write working software → as an engineer, I’m just as confused and disappointed as anyone else

Fact: Studies out of [Harvard, MIT, and Stanford](https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity) all show “AI workslop” is on the rise! → most teams serious about avoiding workslop are spending hours reworking the output that took minutes to generate → it’s backwards!

[Viral post in the tech community yesterday about the new ChatGPT browser called Atlas](https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/22/atlas-anti-web-browser/) said **3. You’re the agent for the browser, it’s not being an agent for you** → it’s halloween and they tricked us! 👻

Fact: Most of what people are selling as AI, agents, and assistants today is just traditional software.

Fact: Even the best AI models forget what I said 10 minutes ago, and while agents provide “memory” it still performs much worse than the least capable person I’ve ever hired or managed.

Fact: AI has a “too many tools” problem ([explained in this video](https://youtu.be/bAYZjVAodoo)) means we get the best results today when AI agents are dumber, not smarter, and can only do a few very specific tasks → like custom ChatGPTs that keep it bite-sized (or fun-sized)

> **Big idea: Nobody has a true virtual workforce, yet. It’s BS. You haven’t missed out. Every AI tool today still needs heavy training and ongoing supervision.**

### What is Superwork (or a Superseller)?

Simply put, it’s anyone who manages to consistently reduce hours of their work into minutes. And they do this with supervised, AI-accelerated tools and workflows.

Salespeople who do superwork become Supersellers.

And as I was saying before, supervised work is the only real AI work worth doing right now.

For bootstrapped solofounders, there are superwork opportunities in every category—from developing the idea for your business to positioning, messaging, nurturing, listening, responding, managing bookings, sending proposals, closing, renewing, invoicing, all the way through to the unique ways you service and support your customers.

First you identify which parts of your work you want to augment, then you craft the supervised workflow that helps you do it faster either on demand or in the background on a daily loop.

It’s not about automating you; it’s about upgrading you.

**Personal examples**

In May, I found I could consistently displace about 10 hours of app design and development work with a single prompt → the hard truth is user research and validation is still slow

This year, I moved from shipping a new web site every month to every week → the hard truth is content development and editing is still slow

My wife is thrilled that I can press one button and convert all our bank transactions from the year into the Schedule C we give to our CPA to file our taxes (she, our accountant, said really good job!! with lots of exclamation points and she doesnt normally use exclamation points which tells me we saved her time and headache as well)

Leading AI company Anthropic predicts the first one person unicorn or billion dollar company will emerge next year. The creator of ChatGPT says in 3 years. Regardless, it’s clear bootstrapped solofounders are in the best spot to take advantage of AI tools that already exist.

> **Superselling is a movement that is already happening and I hope everyone here leaves today with an idea for how to transform your daily work.**

### What can we expect in the future?

[The largest survey of reputable AI researchers to date](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02843) showed the odds of Artificial General Intelligence emerging are 50% by 2047 and 90% by the end of the century. ([Another survey mostly agrees.](https://aiimpacts.org/agi-09-survey/))

That means everything still requires you for the next few decades.

That tax software I built for myself can serve all bootstrapped, solo-founders someday, but again I haven’t found an AI to package it up and launch it for me, yet.

Digital clones are going to emerge → this summer I had a client start funding my attempts to clone myself digitally which is still a WIP → his name is Mitt → I’m also attempting to clone Darrin and Joey → my wife told me about the Braintree founder [Bryan Johnson who is trying to live forever](https://www.bryanjohnson.com) and I said his odds are much better digitally than physically → so maybe I’ll try to sell to that guy → Audience of One, right, Darrin?

Failure rates will improve, but full-time, autonomous, unsupervised workers will still not exist for the next couple decades → there is a slight chance we’ll have real-time video clones by the end of this decade

> **The point is this. Your job isn’t disappearing; it’s evolving. The sooner you start training your tools, the more they’ll serve you later.**

### Relevance to Scale Summit framework

As a member of Scale Summit for almost 2 years now, I wish I had superselling tools and workflows from the very beginning because I believe the results are much better when you can do more faster given all the same steps, questions, and content.

I predict the time-to-returns will be 2–3x faster and magnitude of those returns will be 2–3x higher for bootstrapped solo-founders who adopt Superselling workflows versus those who don’t.

For example, we talk about sorting prospects into Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Irrelevant buckets so it’s easy to see who is worth your time and energy. Joey is going to demo a scoring mechanism in Clay that automatically sifts out prospects from your targeting list based on whatever criteria and limits you provide.

### What should a small, scrappy owner do now?

Keep it visceral. Start with the work you dread tomorrow. Especially if its the same work that drained you already this week.

Use ChatGPT + Clay to supervise your own automations.

If you can master just these two tools alone, you’ll already be in the top 1% of the workforce. Joey is going to demo some of this today.

A quick rule of thumb for ChatGPT: **If you’ve done it before, don’t start from scratch next time** → this where custom GPTs are a good investment → think of it like training an employee → how much would you say to make sure they understand how to do the job correctly? are they doing it correctly right now? can you trust them to do the job correctly tomorrow? is there room for improvement or are you happy enough to move onto training a new skill? → custom ChatGPTs will force consistent results much better than the automatic memory you can’t easily control → if you are doing on demand research, you can still start from scratch and Joey will show you Agent mode

> **Your first two “virtual employee” hires → one is there when you need to collaborate in ChatGPT or Atlas, and one is working in the background in Clay → both are part-time and require daily supervision**

What I’m noticing behind the scenes is most people doing valuable things in ChatGPT are NOT sharing it because they risk losing business. We decided to share anyways b/c we either aren’t competing with you or we are and we want to F around and find out.
