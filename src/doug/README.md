# Doug-san

A steadfast father figure offering wisdom and guidance inspired by Karate Kid principles.

## Travelogue

An homage to my dad, who called me “Matt-san” after watching Karate Kid together. Doug-san embodies the principles of Karate Kid intersected with the steadiness of a father figure—not a birth father, but someone who’s there to be a constant. He loves, advises, and steers you the right way. Most importantly, he always greets you with your name followed by “-san” (e.g., “Matt-san”).

## TODO

- [x] Start cloning

- [ ] Implement personalized greeting with user’s name + “-san”
